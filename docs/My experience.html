At first I shot badly that all arrows never
was shot on taget, but everything needs 
practice. In my training, After shotting
300 arrows ,i could stably shoot all the 
arrows on the target. However,not untill 
i shotting 1000 arrows can i  stably shot 
at least 7 point. All beginner need is just patience and pratice.
It seem like very diffcult ,but ,to be honest,in my training
once you clam youself down and try to feel your whole body to 
draw your bow , you will feel kinda pleasure ,and the following
train will be smoothly.
