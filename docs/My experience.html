  <h1>My archery experience</h1>

<p><img src="/images/missing taget.jpg" height="200" style="float:left"/>
<p>At first I shot badly, but everything needs practice. In my training, <p>
<p>After shotting 300 arrows ,i could stably shoot all the arrows on the target. <p>
<p>However,not untill i shotting 1000 arrows can i  stably shot at least 7 point. <p>
<p>All beginner need is just patience and pratice . It seem like very diffcult ,but <p>
<p>,to be honest,in my training once you clam youself down and try to feel your whole <p>
<p> body to draw your bow , you will feel kinda pleasure ,and the following train will smoothly.<p>
