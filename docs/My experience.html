<p><img src="/images/missing taget.jpg" height="200" style="float:left"/>
<p>At first I shot badly that all arrows never was shot on taget, but everything needs practice. <p>
<p>In my training, After shotting 300 arrows ,i could stably shoot all the arrows on the target. <p>
<p>However,not untill i shotting 1000 arrows can i  stably shot at least 7 point. All beginner need <p>
<p>is just patience and pratice . It seem like very diffcult ,but ,to be honest,in my training once you <p>
<p>clam youself down and try to feel your whole  body to draw your bow , you will feel kinda pleasure ,and the following train will be smoothly.<p></span>
