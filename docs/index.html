Hi,my name is 黃宇廷 Huang Yu Ting, but you can 
also call me Billy.My hobbies is archery
(Recurve bow). For me, this sport is not merely 
draw and release.It cultivate my patience and 
comcentration. Every details are important.
Nocking,stance,anchor,aiming and follow through all affect how
accurate you are. I also recommend everyone experience it.
Although at the beginning it will be diffcult, once beginners
try their best to pratice, they will find how interesting it is.

The main components include the bow body of the grip,
the upper and lower arms,and the bow string. The 
materials are composed of low-grade wood, aluminum 
alloy,composite and carbon fiber. It is called a 
"recurved" bow because the two bow arms bend forward
when there is no force, and the bow arms must be bent 
backward and fixed by the bowstring. Archery is to rely
on the tension of the two arms to hold the arrow Shoot 
out instead of relying on the elasticity of the 
bowstring.
