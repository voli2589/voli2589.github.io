<p>   Hi,my name is 黃宇廷 Huang Yu Ting, but you can also call me Billy.My hobbies <p>
<p>   is archery(Recurve bow). For me, this sport is not merely draw and release.<p>
<p>   It cultivate my patience and comcentration. Every details are important. <p>
<p>   Nocking,stance,anchor,aiming and follow through all affect how accurate you are.<p>
<p>   I also recommend everyone experience it.Although at the beginning it will be diffcult,<p>
<p>   once beginners try their best to pratice, they will find how interesting it is.<p>

<h2>Recurve bow</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Recurve_bow_0020.jpg" height="175" style="float:left"/>
<p>  The main components include the bow body of the grip, the upper and lower arms, and <p>
<p>  the bow string. The materials are composed of low-grade wood, aluminum alloy, composite <p
<p>  and carbon fiber. It is called a "recurved" bow because the two bow arms bend forward <p><p>
<p>  when there is no force, and the bow arms must be bent backward and fixed by the bowstring. <p>
<p>  Archery is to rely on the tension of the two arms to hold the arrow Shoot out instead of <p>
<p>  relying on the elasticity of the bowstring.<p>
