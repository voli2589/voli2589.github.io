<center><h1>Recurve bow</h1>
<p>
	<pre>
The main components include the bow body of the grip,
the upper and lower arms,and the bow string. The 
materials are composed of low-grade wood, aluminum 
alloy,composite and carbon fiber. It is called a 
"recurved" bow because the two bow arms bend forward
when there is no force, and the bow arms must be bent 
backward and fixed by the bowstring. Archery is to rely
on the tension of the two arms to hold the arrow Shoot 
out instead of relying on the elasticity of the 
bowstring.
