	Polar bears and some grizzly bears are the largest land carnivores today. When the cubs are born, the weights of male and female bears are about the same for about three or four months, but the head circumference of male bears will be larger, and then the height and weight will start to vary greatly depending on the sex. Generally speaking, an adult male bear can stand up to 8.3 feet tall and weigh up to 1760 pounds, which is equivalent to 3-4 male African lions. The adult female bear will be much smaller, but it is also about 990 pounds and 2.1 meters.
