	<h1>Prevention</h1>
	<pre>
Here are some important points that you need to ensure to stay safe from any potential accident in the future.
Before beginning the real archery sessions, beginners should know all the proper postures, handling techniques,
and shooting techniques as well. Always invest in some good quality equipment. As a beginner, you donâ€™t have to 
start with those killer arrows rather go with a normal arrow for practicing.Never forget to warm up before sessions.
It is highly recommended to practice light exercises every time you go for archery to loosen up your muscles and 
avoid strains and cramps.Last but not least, practice good and safe archery.Never indulge in improper shots or stuff 
like dry firing.
